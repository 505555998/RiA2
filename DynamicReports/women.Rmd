# Regression Report                                           

```{r echo=FALSE, results='hide'}                             
n <- nrow(women)
fit <- lm(weight ~ height, data=women)
sfit <- summary(fit)
b <- coefficients(fit)
```

Linear regression was used to model the relationship between 
weights and height in a sample of `r n` women. The equation              
**weight = `r b[[1]]` +  `r b[[2]]` * height**                
accounted for `r round(sfit$r.squared,2)`% of the variance 
in weights. The ANOVA table is given below.

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
library(xtable)                                               
print(xtable(sfit), type="html")
```

The regression is plotted in the following figure.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=5, fig.height=4}
library(ggplot2)
qplot(height, weight, data=women,
      geom=c("point", "smooth"), method="lm")
```
